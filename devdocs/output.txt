echo_tokens.h:
	
		This function:
			retframe echo_tokens_entrypoint( stackpair *stkp, void *v );
	... expects a pointer to a token to be on top of the data stack, and after
	investigating which type of token it is, dispatches execution to the
	appropriate function, which will print it's representation to standard out.
	The pointer is poped before return.
