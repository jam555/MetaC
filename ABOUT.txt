	This is a project to create a reimagined version of the common C and C++
preprocessors. It is run solely by Jared A. Maddox <absinthdraco@gmail.com>, and
is not yet in a usable state.

	If you're trying to compile with Microsoft tools, then just run "make.bat",
which'll properly call nmake for you. Otherwise just run whatever your make tool
is directly.

	The "root" directory "external_dependencies" is tasked with containing the
external dependencies, currently limited to version 4 of LibAndria. All
dependencies must have THEIR OWN directory inside of "external_dependencies",
they MUST NOT be extracted/downloaded directly into it for the sake of never
stomping on other dependencies.

	The "root" directory "overrides" is tasked with containing... overrides. It
is ignored by Git, because it's meant to be used by individual users, instead of
by the project as a whole; it's simply a place to look for per-user build-time
hooks in.
	A file called "overrides/rootoverride.make" will provide overriding
variables to the directly-executed makefile, while "overrides/override.make"
will provide overriding variables to the "common.make" file that contains
platform-specific "tool" variables (such as the invocation command for the
actual make tool itself).
	Additional override capabilities may be defined at some later point in time,
but currently they're all used by the makefile system only.
