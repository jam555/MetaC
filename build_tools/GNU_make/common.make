# A set of common defines for GNU makefiles. Use this as a template for what
#  files for other "make" variants need to support. The equivalent file for
#  other "makes"s needs to have the same file name: "common.make".
# Note that while the variables "basification_path" and
#  "basification_extension" are required by this file, but cannot be
#  provided by it: they form the path that moves the file reference back to
#  the project-root, and are actually needed in order to find this very
#  file. They SHOULD NOT end in a directory divider, just in case they need
#  to be used without that in the future. Don't override them in your
#  override.make, but you CAN override project_base, which is a shallow
#  wrapper around basification_path, if you need (*_extension is
#  specifically used for makefiles in subdirectories).

# Note that we assume some Bash compatible shell in this file
