Special note:
	The FAILED * FUNC macros should probably be supplemented with versions that implement the standard assigned-and-if() construct. That will save MANY lines.
	Probably need to check all the files for *_refid variables, and delete them. Caught some, but probably not all.


err.c:
	Line 1017: What goes there?
	might need some sort of debug/release mode?

demo_errs.c:
	has a lot of STACK_* macros: the STACK_* bit on frpont has no particular point.

lexalike.c:
	has a lot of STACK_* macros: the STACK_* bit on frpont has no particular point.
	has a lot of functions like bin2num: these should be moved to a distinct file for reusability & increased comprehensibility.
	The extrachar stuff should probably be moved to a different file for the same reasons.
	has at least one TODO about an old comment- update that comment.
	Line 974 in stack_testchar has a TODO about a custom error message.
	Needs trigraph support added in.
lexalike.h:
	Will need to be synced with some lexalike.c changes.

source.c:
	There's a TODO at the top asking about error reporting. Do we want to move the error reporting system in?

basics.c:
	Line 249 has a bit of error reporting that's probably worthy of it's own custom error reporter.
	Where is pack_arglist() defined (Note: components.c- so why is it declared in basics.h)? Same for vm_pop_macroarg() (same, so same)?

components.c:
	Starting at line 80, "default" isn't really defined.
	Line 128, searchstack_deinit() isn't filled out at all.
	components_sequencedsearchproceed() has a note saying it needs to be reviewed
	Line 549 has a note about the macroargs stuff needing to be in it's own file.
	Line 800- verify if something else needs to go at the "???".
	Line 834- see "Line 800".
	All of the pack_arglist() stuff has references to old-style error reporting in it's arguments- fix that in both use & definition.
	Line 1259- Again "???", but also a not about free()s. Check into that.
	Line 1292- "???", with a note to do deallocation.
	Line 1382- Some note that might need to be deleted, moved, or rewritten.
	Various things (e.g. the macro_link stuff) may deserve to be broken out into it's own files to improve clarity.

exec.h:
	The whole file needs to be examined for rewriting.
	Some stuff from components.c seems to be declared here- is it also declared in components.h?
	Line 107 has a "???" in a struct definition.

freshline_directives.c:
	This frankly hasn't REALLY been written yet.

echo_tokens.c:
	Do we want to add error reporting to echo_tokenhead()?
	More STACK_* macros that don't need to start like that.

complexlex.c:
	dealloc_tokengroup() and similar need to have the old "refid" error reporting removed from function sigs.
	Line 159: Apparently I was uncertain about something here. Best to check.
	Line 613: A note about a function set/function that should be built. Might be further down in same file already...
complexlex.h:
	Line 95: Same note as 613 in .c

simplelex.c:
	Line 195: I think I got the two returns below this wrong. They probably need to be errors.
	Line 420: Does anything else belong here?
	Line 689: Maybe have the wrong variable?
	Line 763: And again.
	Line 832: and again...
	Line 921: Do we want to actrually add this check?
	Line 925: See line 832.
	Line 1041: Again.
	Line 1395: Maybe make a macro to package these error actions, so that can be used four times to save lines?
simplelex.h:
	Need some note on unused vs other chars.

token.h:
	Line 20: Need to check all the files for other definitions of struct token.
	Need some notes on *_INVALID vs *_OTHER
	Line 163 & 165: Finish these defines.

headers.h:
	Need to verify that all the relevant headers are included. Maybe make sub-headers for modularity?

stack.c:
	Do we want to add the error reporting to the stack functions?
	Line 376: If a specific error is going to be used, then it should be BY NAME, not simply by number.
	Line 453: Same.
	Line 464: And again.
	Line 476: And again.
	Line 519: I suspect this needs an error return.
	Line 545: There's a note here about verifying the proper use of (token_head*)->length.

tokenmatching.c:
	Various STACK_* macros should probably have the STACK_ bit removed.
	Various functions have args from the previous style of error reporting: need to fix that.
	Line 406: Should this REALLY be fixed instead of deleted? I think I may have moved past this.


Finally: Finish the whole preprocessor!
