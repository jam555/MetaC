Special note:
	The FAILED * FUNC macros should probably be supplemented with versions that implement the standard assigned-and-if() construct. That will save MANY lines.
	Probably need to check all the files for *_refid variables, and delete them. Caught some, but probably not all.

Aaaand the file is already out of date. Have been using already-defined stuff for the FAILED * FUNC macro note above. So, lots of line numbers below are off...

freshline_directives.c looks likely to just be an older version of exec.c and macroargs.c, so figure out if it should be deleted.


err.c:
	might need some sort of debug/release mode?

demo_errs.c:

lexalike.c:
	any functions left that belong elsewhere?
	has at least one TODO about an old comment- update that comment.
	Line 974 in stack_testchar has a TODO about a custom error message.
	Needs trigraph support added in.
lexalike.h:
	Will need to be synced with some lexalike.c changes.
	is_freshline() should be declared elsewhere- move it.
		Actually, is that true?

basics.c:
	Line 249 has a bit of error reporting that's probably worthy of it's own custom error reporter.

components.c:
	Starting at line 80, "default" isn't really defined.
	Line 128, searchstack_deinit() isn't filled out at all.
	components_sequencedsearchproceed() has a note saying it needs to be reviewed
	Just split off the macroargs.c stuff- are all of those error reporting macros still needed?
	Also, since so much stuff got split off, every note below here is probably obsolete.
	Line 549 has a note about the macroargs stuff needing to be in it's own file.
	Line 800- verify if something else needs to go at the "???".
	Line 834- see "Line 800".
	Line 1259- Again "???", but also a not about free()s. Check into that.
	Line 1292- "???", with a note to do deallocation.
	Line 1382- Some note that might need to be deleted, moved, or rewritten.
macroargs.c:
	This has been freshly split off of components.c- need to go through to double check things.
	Pulled the shufflequeue stuff out for an exec.c file.
exec.c:
	Freshly split- needs review.
exec.h:
	The whole file needs to be examined for rewriting.
	Line 107 has a "???" in a struct definition.

freshline_directives.c:
	This frankly hasn't REALLY been written yet.

echo_tokens.c:
	The error reporting for the putc() and printf() calls needs to be finished. Don't know if it should exit the function or not.

complexlex.c:
	Line 159: Apparently I was uncertain about something here. Best to check.
	Line 613: A note about a function set/function that should be built. Might be further down in same file already...
complexlex.h:
	Line 95: Same note as 613 in .c

simplelex.c:
	Line 410: This default in numberentry_lex() can technically use a character verifier.
	Line 621: A note in brackop_lex() that it would be good to verify the value of th.toktype.
simplelex.h:
	Need some note on unused vs other chars.

token.h:
	Need some notes on *_INVALID vs *_OTHER
	Line 163 & 165: Finish these defines.

headers.h:
	Need to verify that all the relevant headers are included. Maybe make sub-headers for modularity?
	Note: the relevant headers are now definitely NOT up to date.

stack.c:
	Do we want to add the error reporting to the stack functions?
	Line 183: changed the return values, need to check if this breaks anything.
		Note: have changed A LOT of return values. This SHOULDN'T break things, but it MIGHT. Best to check.
		This file shouldn't have problems- fixing it is part of why there's lots of changes...
	Line 593: There's a note here about verifying the proper use of (token_head*)->length.

tokenmatching.c:
	Line 406: Should this REALLY be fixed instead of deleted? I think I may have moved past this.


Finally: Finish the whole preprocessor!
