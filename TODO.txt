Special note:
	The FAILED * FUNC macros should probably be supplemented with versions that implement the standard assigned-and-if() construct. That will save MANY lines.
	Probably need to check all the files for *_refid variables, and delete them. Caught some, but probably not all.

Aaaand the file is already out of date. Have been using already-defined stuff for the FAILED * FUNC macro note above. So, lots of line numbers below are off...

Check .c files for "stackpair std_stacks;"- it may have accidentally been copied to multiple places when adding the new error system.


err.c:
	Line 1017: What goes there?
	might need some sort of debug/release mode?

demo_errs.c:

lexalike.c:
	any functions left that belong elsewhere?
	has at least one TODO about an old comment- update that comment.
	Line 974 in stack_testchar has a TODO about a custom error message.
	Needs trigraph support added in.
lexalike.h:
	Will need to be synced with some lexalike.c changes.
	is_freshline() should be declared elsewhere- move it.
		Actually, is that true?

basics.c:
	Line 249 has a bit of error reporting that's probably worthy of it's own custom error reporter.
	Where is pack_arglist() defined (Note: components.c- so why is it declared in basics.h)? Same for vm_pop_macroarg() (same, so same)?
	Note: the pack_arglist() & similar is NOW in macroargs.c

components.c:
	Starting at line 80, "default" isn't really defined.
	Line 128, searchstack_deinit() isn't filled out at all.
	components_sequencedsearchproceed() has a note saying it needs to be reviewed
	Just split off the macroargs.c stuff- are all of those error reporting macros still needed?
	Also, since so much stuff got split off, every note below here is probably obsolete.
	Line 549 has a note about the macroargs stuff needing to be in it's own file.
	Line 800- verify if something else needs to go at the "???".
	Line 834- see "Line 800".
	All of the pack_arglist() stuff has references to old-style error reporting in it's arguments- fix that in both use & definition.
	Line 1259- Again "???", but also a not about free()s. Check into that.
	Line 1292- "???", with a note to do deallocation.
	Line 1382- Some note that might need to be deleted, moved, or rewritten.
macroargs.c:
	This has been freshly split off of components.c- need to go through to double check things.
	Need to make a .h for this, and move the relevant declarations into it. See exec.h?

exec.h:
	The whole file needs to be examined for rewriting.
	Some stuff from components.c seems to be declared here- is it also declared in components.h?
	Line 107 has a "???" in a struct definition.

freshline_directives.c:
	This frankly hasn't REALLY been written yet.

echo_tokens.c:
	The error reporting for the putc() and printf() calls needs to be finished. Don't know if it should exit the function or not.

complexlex.c:
	dealloc_tokengroup() and similar need to have the old "refid" error reporting removed from function sigs.
	Line 159: Apparently I was uncertain about something here. Best to check.
	Line 613: A note about a function set/function that should be built. Might be further down in same file already...
complexlex.h:
	Line 95: Same note as 613 in .c

simplelex.c:
	Line 195: I think I got the two returns below this wrong. They probably need to be errors.
	Line 420: Does anything else belong here?
	Line 689: Maybe have the wrong variable?
	Line 763: And again.
	Line 832: and again...
	Line 921: Do we want to actually add this check?
	Line 925: See line 832.
	Line 1041: Again.
	
	New:
	Line 187: Add a TRESPASSPATH error.
	Also, have done a lot of rework, so line numbers are wrong now.
simplelex.h:
	Need some note on unused vs other chars.

token.h:
	Line 20: Need to check all the files for other definitions of struct token.
	Need some notes on *_INVALID vs *_OTHER
	Line 163 & 165: Finish these defines.

headers.h:
	Need to verify that all the relevant headers are included. Maybe make sub-headers for modularity?

stack.c:
	Do we want to add the error reporting to the stack functions?
	Line 376: If a specific error is going to be used, then it should be BY NAME, not simply by number.
	Line 453: Same.
	Line 464: And again.
	Line 476: And again.
	Line 519: I suspect this needs an error return.
	Line 545: There's a note here about verifying the proper use of (token_head*)->length.

tokenmatching.c:
	Various functions have args from the previous style of error reporting: need to fix that.
	Line 406: Should this REALLY be fixed instead of deleted? I think I may have moved past this.


Finally: Finish the whole preprocessor!
